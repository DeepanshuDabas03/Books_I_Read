> "It is not what I am saying that is hurting you; it is that you have wounds that I touch by what I have said. You are hurting yourself. There is no way that I can take this personally. Not because I donâ€™t believe in you or donâ€™t trust you, but because I know that you see the world with different eyes, with your eyes. You create an entire picture or movie in your mind, and in that picture you are the director, you are the producer, you are the main actor or actress. Everyone else is a secondary actor or actress. It is your movie"

> " When we really see other people as they are without taking it personally, we can never be hurt by what they say or do. Even if others lie to you, it is okay. They are lying to you because they are afraid. They are afraid you will discover that they are not perfect. It is painful to take that social mask off. If others say one thing, but do another, you are lying to yourself if you donâ€™t listen to their actions. But if you are truthful with yourself, you will save yourself a lot of emotional pain. Telling yourself the truth about it may hurt, but you donâ€™t need to be attached to the pain. Healing is on the way, and itâ€™s just a matter of time before things will be better for you"

Reading The Four Agreements has been a transformative journey for me. It shaped me in ways I didnâ€™t anticipate, bringing clarity to how I perceive myself and the world around me. One of the most impactful shifts it brought was teaching me to stop taking things personally. This realization freed me from unnecessary emotional burdens and helped me focus on what truly matters.

The bookâ€™s principles offered me a fresh lens to interpret interactions, allowing me to recognize that others' actions often have little to do with me and more to do with their own perspectives and experiences. This understanding has been empoweringâ€”itâ€™s given me the strength to let go of overthinking and to stay rooted in my own truth.

The Four Agreements continues to serve as a guide for how I approach relationships, challenges, and my own growth. Its wisdom resonates deeply, reminding me that peace begins within and that I have the power to live a life of authenticity, free from unnecessary negativity.
